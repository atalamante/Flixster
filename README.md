## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

### Notes
I did not face many challenges with making this app. The walkthrough videos were extremely helpful and clear. I am slowly beginning to understand the code that we are writing. I think that with more practice I will begin to understand more and see how it all comes together. I wanted to add more to this app, but I am just not sure how to add some of the bonus suggestions.
